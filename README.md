Back-end application for InvesTinder!

InvesTinder is an application developed by Jo√£o Gabriel Eler Mendes and Victor Lomba in JavaScript using ReactJS to compete in a Hackaton.

This application lets investors connect easily with consultants or advisors, leting them match if they like each other's profile and then providing contact information.

InvesTinder is still on development, so many other features might be added later.

## Usage

After installing all dependencies with yarn or npm i, you can run the back-end with

```bash
node src/index.js
```

## Info

The Back-end application was developed using Node.js, and its responsible for the communication with the database and the services such
as liking, matching, listing users, creating accounts and logging in.

The currently used database is SQLite3, and this application will be deployed using PostgreSQL later on.
